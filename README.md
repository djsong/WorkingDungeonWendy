I don't have a plan to upload the whole sources that make it get compiled as downloaded.
You need to download the UnrealEngine by yourself, setup to get it compiled,
then put Wendy files under the root path.
Project name is Wendy.
In addition, I am not sure if all the required contents are uploaded, while I didn't make any Blueprint logic, still there's content dependency.
Some textures are surely missing but that won't be a big problem for the least functioning.

2021.09.11
The first repository creation.
Unreal version 4.26.2

2025.05.17
Implemented custom image replication networking, a lot faster and stable for two users (one server and one client), but not guaranteed for more than two clients.
Now based on Unreal Engine 5.5
