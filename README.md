# WorkingDungeonWendy
Virtual world capturing and transferring desktop image to simulate virtual office, based on Unreal Engine.

I don't have a plan to upload the whole sources that make it get compiled as downloaded.
You need to download the UnrealEngine by yourself, setup to get it compiled,
then put downloaded files under the root path.
Project name is Wendy.
